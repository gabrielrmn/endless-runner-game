# Overview
Medieval Roads is an endless runner game in 2D that must be controlled using WASD keys. In this game, you have to deflect the enemies by jumping or rolling. As time goes by, will appear hearts and coins - the first one gives more lifes for the player, and the other, more points - and the score is updated. So, you score more points as time goes by and you survive.
